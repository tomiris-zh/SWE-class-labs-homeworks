Across the plain, in the twilight, rode Flann with his noble guest-friends <span id="line_1">&nbsp&nbsp[1]</span><br>
by his side, and his hunting train behind him. They had hunted all day in <span id="line_2">&nbsp&nbsp[2]</span><br>
the woods to the south of the plain—on foot, as the old Irish custom was, <span id="line_3">&nbsp&nbsp[3]</span><br>
while their horses grazed free in the forest glades, and the gillies <span id="line_4">&nbsp&nbsp[4]</span><br>
guarded their masters’ trappings. Now, weary of limb themselves, <span id="line_5">&nbsp&nbsp[5]</span><br>
they were astride their fresh steeds, and the miles that lay between <span id="line_6">&nbsp&nbsp[6]</span><br>
them and the banqueting hall within the white Dún above the Liffey <span id="line_7">&nbsp&nbsp[7]</span><br>
were miles of soft, springy turf. Even the trappers felt their heavy <span id="line_8">&nbsp&nbsp[8]</span><br>
burdens light, as their feet touched it. They raced in time to the <span id="line_9">&nbsp&nbsp[9]</span><br>
joyous concert of the beagles, and the tinkling of the horse-bells—every <span id="line_10">&nbsp&nbsp[10]</span><br>
man of them with his great wolf-dog at his side.<span id="line_11">&nbsp&nbsp[11]</span><br>
The red sunset filled the West, and, in the glow of it, splendid <span id="line_12">&nbsp&nbsp[12]</span><br>
mantles—purple and yellow, and green, and red—were yet <span id="line_13">&nbsp&nbsp[13]</span><br>
more splendid. Gleams of fire were struck from great jewelled <span id="line_14">&nbsp&nbsp[14]</span><br>
brooches, from the gold on bits and bridles, from richly-wrought <span id="line_15">&nbsp&nbsp[15]</span><br>
horse-cloths. Flann himself, a glowing splendid figure, rode at <span id="line_16">&nbsp&nbsp[16]</span><br>
the head of that splendid company, the pride of life in his heart, <span id="line_17">&nbsp&nbsp[17]</span><br>
and crowning his haughtily carried head.<span id="line_18">&nbsp&nbsp[18]</span><br>
They came to a point from which a great oak tree was visible. <span id="line_19">&nbsp&nbsp[19]</span><br>
It seemed to Flann, all at once, as if another hand than his were <span id="line_20">&nbsp&nbsp[20]</span><br>
laid on the bridle, and his horse were being urged out of its <span id="line_21">&nbsp&nbsp[21]</span><br>
straight course for the home stable. He lifted his echlasc, and <span id="line_22">&nbsp&nbsp[22]</span><br>
with it tried to turn the horse’s head back again. But in vain. <span id="line_23">&nbsp&nbsp[23]</span><br>
One way only the horse would go, and that was towards the <span id="line_24">&nbsp&nbsp[24]</span><br>
great oak tree, which spread a wide dark net against the red <span id="line_25">&nbsp&nbsp[25]</span><br>
background of the sunset.<span id="line_26">&nbsp&nbsp[26]</span><br>
“Let it thus be,” said Flann, yielding. “Let us lay the wolf’s <span id="line_27">&nbsp&nbsp[27]</span><br>
head at the holy maiden’s feet, that she may know how her <span id="line_28">&nbsp&nbsp[28]</span><br>
cattle may henceforth graze in peace.” He called out the <span id="line_29">&nbsp&nbsp[29]</span><br>
word to his followers, and presently they were all—horsemen, <span id="line_30">&nbsp&nbsp[30]</span><br>
and runners, and dogs—thundering across the turf due <span id="line_31">&nbsp&nbsp[31]</span><br>
westward.<span id="line_32">&nbsp&nbsp[32]</span><br>
They came to the door of the Lios, which surrounded the <span id="line_33">&nbsp&nbsp[33]</span><br>
cells of the holy maiden, Brigid, and her companions. <span id="line_34">&nbsp&nbsp[34]</span><br>
“Knock loudly,” cried Flann; and a gillie stooped and <span id="line_35">&nbsp&nbsp[35]</span><br>
found the knocker in a niche by the door, and struck the <span id="line_36">&nbsp&nbsp[36]</span><br>
wood heavily with it.<span id="line_37">&nbsp&nbsp[37]</span><br>
The sound of the sliding bolt followed speedily. The <span id="line_38">&nbsp&nbsp[38]</span><br>
door opened, and a white figure stood framed in the <span id="line_39">&nbsp&nbsp[39]</span><br>
door-porch.<span id="line_40">&nbsp&nbsp[40]</span><br>
“Prince Flann,” said a woman’s clear voice, with a note <span id="line_41">&nbsp&nbsp[41]</span><br>
of wonder in it, “a blessing on thee and on thy company. <span id="line_42">&nbsp&nbsp[42]</span><br>
Is it aught of ill befallen Etain, thy wife, which brings thee <span id="line_43">&nbsp&nbsp[43]</span><br>
so late to the door of Brigid’s cell?”<span id="line_44">&nbsp&nbsp[44]</span><br>
